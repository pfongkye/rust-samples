# Rust Language

Rust is a systems programming language. It is usually used to implement "low level" code like in kernels, 
or engines for other languages (JavaScript, TypeScript and the likes), etc.

## Why Rust?

- Rust ensures that every code construct leading to undefined behavior is caught at compilation. We can say it is a safe language.
- Rust supports the developer to code that runs "fast".
- Rust is a parallel programming language that is developer friendly.
